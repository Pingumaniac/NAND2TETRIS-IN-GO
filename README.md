# NAND2TETRIS-IN-GO
* The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles (nand2tetris) Chapter 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 Projects in Go (v1.18.4).
* For Chapter 6 project, I built an assembler that translates Hack assembly language into executable machine code.
* For Chapter 7-8 project, I built a Virtual Machine (VM) translator that translates an intermediate code designed to run on the VM into Hack assembly language.
* For Chapter 10 project, I built a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar into XML.
* For Chapter 11 project, I am building a full-scale front-end compiler that compiles a Jack program into an executable VM code.
